Functions in Dart:
We import libraries to use the code in them using the 'import' keyword.
Functions  are the building blocks of readable, maintainable, and reusable code.
A function is a set of statements to perform a specific task.
The 'runApp()' function is a compulsory starting point of all Flutter apps.
It takes a widget and makes it the root of the widget tree.
It is called oly once in the 'main' function.
The 'main' function is the entry point of the Flutter app.
The 'pubspec.yaml' file manages dependencies in Flutter.
The 'runApp' tells flutter what to display on the screen.

Flutter & Dart Basics:
Functions can take input values called parameters or arguments.
Dart is an OOP language and everything in Dart is an object.
These widgets are like objects and are building blocks of Flutter apps.
The widgets can be combined and nested tgo form a widget tree.
The root widget of the widget tree is usually the 'MaterialApp' widget.
Widgets have properties and methods.
We can also build custom widgets in Flutter.
They can either extend the 'StatelessWidget' or 'StatefulWidget' class.
Functions have either positional or named arguments.
Positional arguments are required while named arguments are optional.
Named arguments can be made compulsory using the 'required' keyword.
Positional arguments can be made optional by enclosing them in square brackets.
They should however be given a default value.
The order of positional arguments is also important.
Named arguments are specified using curly braces in the declaration.

Widgets in Flutter:
Different widgets have different properties and methods
They execute different tasks and have different purposes.
The core widgets are the 'StatelessWidget' and 'StatefulWidget' classes.
The 'StatelessWidget' class is used for widgets that do not change.
The 'StatefulWidget' class is used for widgets with dynamic data.
Some widgets are used for layout while others are used for styling.
The 'Scaffold' widget is used to create a base page design.
The 'AppBar' widget is used to create a top app bar.
The 'Text' widget is used to display text on the screen.
The 'Column' widget is used to display widgets in a vertical manner.
The 'Row' widget is used to display widgets in a horizontal manner.
The 'Container' widget is used for styling and creating layouts.
The 'Image' widget is used to display images on the screen.
The 'Icon' widget is used to display icons on the screen.
The 'ListView' widget is used to display a list of widgets.
The 'Card' widget is used to create cards on the screen.
The 'Stack' widget is used to stack widgets on top of each other.
The 'SafeArea' widget is used to create a safe area on the screen.
The 'Center' widget is used to center widgets on the screen.

Flutter Layouts & Styling:
The following widgets are used for layouts in Flutter:
The 'Container' widget is used for styling and creating layouts.
The 'Row' widget is used to display widgets in a horizontal manner.
The 'Column' widget is used to display widgets in a vertical manner.
The 'ListView' widget is used to display a list of widgets.
The 'Stack' widget is used to stack widgets on top of each other.
The 'SafeArea' widget is used to create a safe area on the screen.
The 'Center' widget is used to center widgets on the screen.
The 'Expanded' widget is used to expand widgets to fill the available space.
The 'Flexible' widget is used to make widgets flexible.
The 'Spacer' widget is used to create space between widgets.
The 'Wrap' widget is used to wrap widgets to the next line if they overflow.
The 'GridView' widget is used to display widgets in a grid format.
The 'SingleChildScrollView' widget is used to make widgets scrollable.
The 'Positioned' widget is used to position widgets in a stack.
The 'Align' widget is used to align widgets in a stack.
The 'SizeBox' widget is used to create space between widgets.
The 'Divider' widget is used to create a horizontal line.
The 'BoxDecoration' widget is used to decorate the box of a widget.
The 'BorderRadius' widget is used to create rounded corners.
The 'BoxShadow' widget is used to create shadows for widgets.
The 'LinearGradient' widget is used to create linear gradients.
The 'RadialGradient' widget is used to create radial gradients.

Flutter Data Types:
Dart is a strongly typed language.
It has the following data types:
Numbers: int, double
Strings: String
Booleans: bool
Lists: List
Maps: Map
Runes: Runes
Symbols: Symbol
The 'var' keyword is used to declare variables whose data type is not known.
The 'final' keyword is used to declare variables whose value cannot change.
The 'const' keyword is used to declare variables whose value is constant.
The 'final' and 'const' keywords are used to declare constants.
The 'late' keyword is used to declare variables whose value is known at run time.
Constants are declared at compile time and not run time.
The 'final' keyword is used to declare variables whose value is known at run time.
Variables with 'final' keyword cannot be reassigned.
Widgets are also data types in Flutter.
?+
Values can also have multiple types in Dart.
The 'dynamic' keyword is used to declare variables whose data type can change.
The 'const' keyword improves performance by making variables immutable.
The 'this' keyword is used to refer to the current instance of the class.

Flutter Operators:
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
The following are the types of operators in Dart:
Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %, ++, --
Equality and relational operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
Type test operators: as, is, is!
Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, ??=
Logical operators: &&, ||, !
Bitwise and shift operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
The '??' operator is used to assign a default value to a variable.
The '?' operator makes a variable nullable.
The '!' operator is used to make a variable non-nullable.

Generic Types & Gradient Backgrounds:
The 'List' data type is used to store multiple values in a single variable.
The 'Map' data type is used to store key-value pairs in a single variable.
The 'Set' data type is used to store unique values in a single variable.
The 'List' data type can take different data types hence generic.
The 'LinearGradient' widget is used to create linear gradients.
The 'RadialGradient' widget is used to create radial gradients.
A gradient is a transition between two or more colors.
The gradients are used with the 'BoxDecoration' widget.
The 'BoxDecoration' widget is used with the 'Container' widget.
The 'BoxDecoration' widget is used to decorate the box of a widget.

Flutter Classes:
Widgets qre objects in Flutter.
Objects are data structures in memory.
Classes are therefore blueprints for creating objects.
Objects are data structures consisting of data properties and methods.
We use the '.' operator to access properties and methods of an object.
Classes have constructor functions which are used to create objects.
Constructors have the same name as the class.
Constructors are used to initialize objects.
Constructors can also be used to pass arguments to objects.
Constructors can also be used to set default values for properties.
Custom and built-in widgets are defined as classes.

Building Custom Widgets:
They should be stored in a separate file and imported when needed.
Custom widgets extend from either the 'StatelessWidget' or 'StatefulWidget' class.
The 'StatelessWidget' class is used for widgets that do not change.
The 'StatefulWidget' class is used for widgets with dynamic data.
Stateless widgets have the following properties:
They must override the 'build' method and return a widget.
They should have a const constructor function that calls the super constructor.
They should return a widget in the 'build' method.
They should have a named 'key' parameter in the constructor.
They should have final properties.
Stateful widgets have the following properties:
They must override the 'createState' method and return a state.
They should have a const constructor function that calls the super constructor.
The 'createState' method returns a state of type 'stateful widget'.
The state class must override the 'build' method and return a widget.

Splitting Code into Multiple Files:
Necessary to split code into multiple files for large projects.
This increases the readability, and reusability of the code.
The 'import' keyword is used to import code from other files.
The 'export' keyword is used to export code to other files.
The 'as' keyword is used to give a file an alias.

Flutter Variables:
Variables are data containers.
They can be created in different ways.
They can also have different types and values.
The preferred naming convention for variables is camelCase.
